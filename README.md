# Used Car Price Prediction Model
## Abstract:
Machine learning is a technology that has seen a
rapid increase in popularity and usage over the last few years.
It is rapidly progressing with vast capabilities and applications
in automating processes that do not require human
participation or explicit programming. The power of machine
learning is so strong that its applications may be found
practically everywhere in our daily lives. Many previously
unsolved problems have been solved by machine learning, and
businesses around the world have advanced significantly. In this
project, we'll look at one such real-world scenario and use
machine learning to create a model. The price of the car begins
to decrease as soon as it is purchased, and continues to
depreciate with every passing year. The value of a car drops to
1/5th of its price in the first year. Our goal is to create a machine
learning model that estimates the value based on characteristics
such as total kilometres driven, overall vehicle condition, and
several other parameters that influence the car's resale value in
the Indian market. As we advance with this project, we'd like to
train our model to not only anticipate the price, but also to assist
the seller in obtaining the best possible price.

## Dataset:
The data was downloaded from kaggle having 1000 enteries and 6 columns. The 5 features of the ML model are: company, model,fuel_type, kms_driven and the year. 
| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `company` | The company of the car eg: Tesla, Maruti etc|
| `model` | Show model of the car eg: Maruti Suzuki 800 |
| `fuel_type` | Indicates the fuel type of the model eg: Petrol, Diesel etc |
| `year` | The year in which the car was purchased |
| `kms_driven` | The number of kilometers the car has driven |
